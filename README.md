<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

The project is done for an event named 'Softablitz' under the technical festival 'Avishkar 2020' of Motilal Nehru National Institute of Technology, Allahabad. The project MUSAFIR is an app that provides a medium for both railway authority and passengers. Through this app, the Railway Authority can easily manage all the trains and various other facilities. They can keep an eye on multiple activities such as running trains on a particular day, canceling trains, removing them, rerouteing them, etc. It also eases passengers' lives for booking tickets, sees trains according to their requirements, manages their booking history, checks PNR status, etc.

<!-- There are many great README templates available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements. -->
